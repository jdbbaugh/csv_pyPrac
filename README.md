# Python csv parseing

NOTE:
Script provides function.  If you run the script as is with DATA_MERGED.CSV by it in root file it'll spit out a MERGED_METRICS_Jul.CSV for July.  In the script you could also change the functions 2nd property to Jun and get a MERGED_METRICS_Jun.CSV for June.  In theory any .csv with the same header as well as a {day}-{month} listing for the "DAY" could be placed as parameters and that months metrics.
